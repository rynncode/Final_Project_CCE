# Transactional Ballot Casting Voting System
A desktop-based Ballot Casting System built with Java Swing, designed for secure and user-friendly electronic voting. It enables users to register, log in, and cast votes while ensuring voter anonymity through a Mixnet-based algorithm, concealing the link between voters and their votes. A Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is also applied to maintain data consistency across storage files, guaranteeing each transaction as either fully completed or rolled back in case of failure. An integrated admin panel allows authorized users to manage candidates, monitor voter activity, and oversee the voting ledger. All data is stored persistently in CSV files for candidates, voters, and votes, preserving records between sessions.    

## üó≥Ô∏è Project Overview   
The Online Voting System allows users to:   

‚Ä¢ Register and manage voter accounts.

‚Ä¢ Log in securely to access the voting portal.  

‚Ä¢ Cast votes electronically for available candidates.   

‚Ä¢ View vote tallies and election results.    

‚Ä¢ Allow administrators to manage candidates, view voter activity, and monitor the voting ledger.    

This version does not implement a database. Instead, all data is stored in .csv files located in the /src/final_proj/data directory.

## Pending Integration
votes.csv needs to have further privacy functions (make it unable to be read by the devs/admin)
-> for now, due to testing it is visible
Make an admin function to delete candidates
Adjust vote tally / voting form ui to be more aesthetically pleasing
Time complexity and Storage Complexity (show time elapsed to how the program ran in ms/nanos/etc)
add
